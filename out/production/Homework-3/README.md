## Clustering the control charts

Data Description: The dataset synthetic_control_data.txt contains 600 examples of control chart time series data. The data is stored in an ASCII file, 600 rows, 60 columns, with a single chart per line. There are six different classes of control charts:
* Normal
* Cyclic
* Increasing trend 
* Decreasing trend 
* Upward shift
* Downward shift

The following image shows ten examples from each class: (A) Downward Trend. (B) Cyclic. (C) Normal. (D) Upward Shift. (E) Upward Trend. (F) Downward Shift.

Task Description:
1) Clustering: implement k-means clustering algorithm from scratch using Java to find six clusters from control chart data. Once the clusters are formed, extract the examples that belong to the same cluster into a .txt file. All together, your program should output
six .txt files.

2) Visualization using RapidMiner: Use appropriate “chart view” to visualize the six clusters found from the previous step. As an example, the following graph is the visualization of one cluster using RapidMiner.

3) Clustering and Visualization using R: use R to generate six clusters from control chart data, and use R to visualize the six clusters.
